        You run home. It feels good to get rid of some of this nervous energy even if it's a little warm.

          Jupyter notebooks are really great at doing the first. But sometimes they can be a little unweildy.

          But there are a whole bunch of anti-patterns, or workaround behaviours that I've observed that stem from the disconnect between natural process of data-analysis, and the format in which we express that analysis on the page.
          I'm going to pick a few of these, and then present some potential design solutions.

### Story
It's a sunny day in Portland, Oregon. You've just left home, and are walking to give a presentation about some work you are super excited about. The sidewalk you are walking on is tiled. Do you:
  a. ignore the tiles and continue walking
  b. adjust your stride so that you don't step on the edges between tiles

---

As you carry on walking some dude looking at his phone almost walks into, luckily you sidestep and avoid having his coffee poured all over you. The coffee smells pretty good though, and Upper Left Roasters is just round the corner. Do you:
  a. go grab a coffee to give you energy for your talk
  b. carry on walking so that you don't end up late

---

You pick up the pace and walk briskly to the coffee shop. It's been a while since you got a coffee from here and the coffee at work just doesn't cut it. As you walk in to the shop you see a friend from high-school.

"Grace! How are you?!" 

It turns out Grace is sad because she's just about to move back to Chicago and the home she found for her cat Tommy can't take her anymore as they've found out their kid has allergies. 

You adopt a cat!
