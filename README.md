===========================

[Computational notebooks that reflect the mental model of humans]{.c12}

[A core tenet of user-centered design is that user interfaces should, as
much as possible, reflect the prior mental model that the user has of a
process. Just as syscall API hides hardware-specific details from
programmers developing applications, abstractions at each level of a
user interface offer an opportunity to reduce the mental load on the
user, enabling them to perform more complex tasks and make fewer
mistakes. However these abstractions, however well implemented, will
often have tradeoffs in terms of the complexity or performance of the
application.]{.c0}

[Computational notebooks, such as Jupyter and Wolfram, have had broad
success by reflecting in their interface an existing user model i.e.
“this code produces this visualisation” by allowing multimedia to be
embedded as part of a script. Jupyter has arguably had more success not
only because it is free software, but also by piggybacking on existing
programming languages which allows users to transfer previously applied
models into a new context, rather than having to learn something new.
Both types of computational notebooks also reflect the modularity
inherent in analysis pipelines, reading in some files might take more
than one line of code but most of the time we just want to think about
the process as “reading in the files”. In programming language design
this is solved using functions, modules and namespaces, in computational
notebooks it is reflected in the UI in the form of code cells. ]{.c0}

[Part of the reason behind the success of Jupyter notebooks in data
science applications has been their … at bringing code and
visualisations closer together, thus allowing users to keep the
operations that are performed on data closer to the representation of
the results itself. This was a .. step forward in data science UI in
general. However, we have observed that usage patterns of the software
reveal that there is still plenty of room for getting even closer to
user’s model of data analytical process. We propose a new interface for
the jupyter and related notebook back-ends that borrows concepts from
graphical programming languages, version control, staged builds and
continuous deployment systems.]{.c0}
