### Services Requested
What service area(s) are you requesting assistance in? *
- User Research/Study
- User Experience Design

### What parts of the project are you seeking assistance for? *
Web application

### How will this assistance help further your project's goals? *
The project addresses a clear usability deficit in a widely-used and open project. While I currently have both the time (I am currently a Mozilla Fellow) and experience in web development / data science to build a prototype I do not have the necessary skills in design or user experience research. The ideas I have for the design of the interface for this project are relatively concrete but are difficult to convey and seek feedback on without visual representations or simple prototypes.

I learnt about this project on a design residency hosted by SimplySecure and was encourage to apply by Elio Qoshi, of Ura Design.

### Describe why your project is important to internet freedom specifically as it relates to OTF’s mission and focus areas: *
*… the best way to protect these freedoms is to passionately support a free and open internet.*  
Not only will this project be free and open itself but it also aims to lift up the capabilities of existing software such as Jupyter notebooks where resource-limitations have so far prevented enough focus on user experience.  

*… in the doctrine of open philanthropy and governance, to share openly with the public and other stakeholders, in a non-competitive fashion, all possible aspects of our work, including what we have learned.*  
As this will initially be conducted as part of my Mozilla fellowship I will be sharing progress on the project as it happens. I am also committed to working with any existing stakeholders and supporting other open projects along the way as much as possible.

*… to sustain long-standing positive change, we must be more than just makers of technology. We must also shift social norms, improve laws, and affect market forces. We strive to identify the root of a challenge, it’s interconnectedness, so that we can be apart of holistic solutions.*  
Making data science accessible is one of the core goals of the project. I truly believe that an important barriers to this is the lack of approachable and user-friendly software for doing data science. However I fully agree that we must continuously assess the impact of a project fully considering the multitude of contexts in which it will be used as well as the multidisciplinary approach that must be taken for any long-lasting change to happen. 

*… in prioritizing sustainable and holistic strategies over resolving issues efficiently. To do so, we empower existing networks addressing challenges, and focus on strategies that work in situations where scarce resources or intersecting systems of oppression may exist.*  
One of the goals for the design is to make sure that this interface is robust to high-latency, low-bandwidth internet connections. 

*… the actual impact of any effort we support should be measured by evaluating the experience of those who are at the receiving end of the engagement.*  
This is why I would like to have support in doing some broader user research after the initial interface design.

*… cultivating a diverse and collaborative network of communities is at the core of what we do; that our power originates from our depth and relevance in those communities and the individual efforts within our organization.
… our strongest moments are when we listen, are changed by what we hear, and follow those diverse voices while solving the most pressing challenges collectively. We emphasize a community’s power, not its powerlessness.*  
We would like this project to tap into the amazing community that already exists around jupyter and scientific python. However we appreciate that the community is currently under-resourced and so would like to ask for extensive feedback when the project design that is well-developed and easy to understand so as to minimize the burden on the community whilst taking advantage and hopefully adding to its power. 

### Has your project undergone an independent digital security audit in the past three years? *
No

### Are you willing to allow outputs from this engagement to be posted publicly by OTF and/or our Usability Lab service partners?
Yes
