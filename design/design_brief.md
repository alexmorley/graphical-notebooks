# Design Brief

## Who am I?
I'm a fellow at the Mozilla Foundation. My background is in neuroscience, software and data science. My goals are to make data science more accessible and reproducible. I believe strong in the principles of human-centered design, as well as in the value of open software, and the community that surrounds it. You can find a little bit more about the other types of projects I'm working on [here](https://github.com/alexmorley/mozilla-open-fellowship/blob/master/README.md).

## Project
### What are we doing?
We are building an experimental interface for Jupyter notebooks that better matches the process of how people do data science. Our research has shown that while the notebook presents the user with a linear interface, the processes which the user goes through tend to be branching. We are thus aiming to design an interface that reflects that tree like structure. We beleive that this, and additional UI considerations will also improve modularity and encourage better code structure.

### Why are we doing it?
Our downstream goal from this is to make notebooks more modular, by enabling individual cells to be re-used, and thus re-mixable. 

## Goals and Objectives
1. Static, Medium-Fidelity Design of the core interface
### This includes:
- How cells can be layed out.
- User journey - new notebook - I want to find out the correlation between x and y and plot it. For dataset 1 and 2.
- User journey - explore notebook - I want to find out how this was done and see what change this variable would make.
- User journey - re-mix/re-use parts - I want to re-use this plotting method in one of my notebooks.
### This does not include:
- Authentication / Login or Landing pages

### In order to achieve:
The aim here is to be able to communicate better to key stakeholders the proposal in a clear, detailed fashion. These stakeholders will include the Jupyter core team as well as funding bodies.

2. Interactive Prototype of the above.
### Additionally this includes:
- Functioning web app that works for predefined examples.
- Considerations of how interactive features affect the the journeys above.
### This does not include:
- Authentication / Login or Landing pages

### In order to achieve:
On top of communicating to key stakeholders we also would like to be able to solicit detailed feedback from users. The goal with this part of the project is to facilitate that, as well as provide a prototype that may be built upon later into the final product.

4. Target audience

Another way to inform your design decisions is to develop a solid understanding of the users who will be interacting with your client’s website.

If you’re lucky, your client will already be equipped with relevant research about their target audience and be willing to share it with you. However, not all business owners will have this information. If you find yourself in this circumstance, you have two options. You can try to use this opportunity to offer user research services as a value-add to the project. If they don’t bite, try asking them who their ideal customer is and work together to build an audience persona through discussion.

Your audience persona should include demographics such as age and gender, as well as psychographics like media consumption habits. This information can unveil important details about what resonates most with your client’s customers online. Are they apt to use mobile more than desktop? Do certain colors resonate more with their lifestyle?

Hopefully by defining their audience in your design brief, you’ll be armed to make informed decisions during design.

5. Design requirements

By including specific design requirements in your design brief, you can ensure you and your team has everything needed to work efficiently and meet client expectations. These details will not only round out your brief, but will also ensure that you don’t find yourself redesigning once you receive specs after the fact.

While requirements may vary for each project, you can include any of the following details about your deliverables:

    Asset dimensions/resolutions
    File formats
    Required color palette
    Image assets to be included
    Associated copy documents

It is also worthwhile to include any reference materials in this section. These could include brand guidelines, mockups, moodboards, and anything else you feel could assist with the completion of the project. The more thorough your supporting documentation is, the less chance you’ll run into roadblocks while working through the design itself.
6. Budget and schedule

If you work in an agency, budgets and schedules are often seen as an afterthought and left for the client services team to deal with. However, these project components are just as vital for creatives as they are for your account services counterparts, and are unignorable for those of you working as freelancers.

The budget

Having a clear understanding of your client’s budget allows you to effectively manage their expectations as to what their money can get them, while also controlling how your team uses their time. When initially meeting with your client to scope out their job, make sure you allocate budget across all disciplines: research, design, copywriting, development, coordination, testing, and review. That way, you’re much more likely to avoid scope creep.

Without an explicit budget, it can be easy for you or your team to dive deep into a job and lose track of how many billable hours you’ve spent. To help avoid this type of situation, I also recommend using a time tracking app to help stay within the budgetary limits of the project.

The schedule

Projects need to stay on time to stay profitable — that’s why schedules are a must-have for your briefs. Your schedule should be realistic and account for potential changes or unexpected obstacles.

An effective schedule should not only highlight the final deadline, but also identify any progress milestones between the onset and endpoint of the project. It is crucial that your team can mutually anticipate completion dates for concepts, final designs, development work, and review periods.

While schedules are vital for keeping your team on track, they can also be valuable for your clients. Some clients you’ll work with won’t know how long it takes to research, design, and build a website. Thus, it’s important to set the expectation of what’s realistic and possible with them when creating your design brief. This, just like the entire design brief, ensures your team and client are on the same page from the get-go.
